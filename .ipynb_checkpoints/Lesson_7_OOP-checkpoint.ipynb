In other languages like C++ or Java, price could be explicitly labeled as a private variable. This would prohibit an object from accessing the price attribute directly like `shirt_one._price = 15`. Unlike other languages, Python does not distinguish between private and public variables. Therefore, there is some controversy about using the underscore convention as well as get and set methods in Python. Why use `get` and `set` methods in Python when Python wasn't designed to use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, you'll find that some Python programmers develop object-oriented programs using `get` and `set` methods anyway. Following the Python convention, the underscore in front of price is to let a programmer know that price should only be accessed with `get` and `set` methods rather than accessing price directly with `shirt_one._price`. However, a programmer could still access `_price` directly because there is nothing in the Python language to prevent the direct access.\n",

    "One of the benefits of `set` and `get` methods is that, as previously mentioned in the course, you can hide the implementation from your user. Perhaps, originally, a variable was coded as a list and later became a dictionary. With `set` and `get` methods, you could easily change how that variable gets accessed. Without set and get methods, you'd have to go to every place in the code that accessed the variable directly and change the code."
